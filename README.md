# VGG Architecture for Food Image Classification

## Overview
This notebook implements a **VGG-style Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for multi-class food image classification using PyTorch.  
It covers data downloading, preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization.

The dataset is organized into `train` and `test` directories with subfolders representing each class.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Image Classification Dataset](https://programmingoceanacademy.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/image_classification_dataset.zip)  
- **Structure:**
```

data/
food\_images/
dataset/
train/
class1/
class2/
...
test/
class1/
class2/
...

````
- Contains food images categorized into multiple classes for supervised training.

---

## Features
- **Automated dataset download** and extraction.
- **PyTorch DataLoader** for batching and shuffling.
- **Data Augmentation** with `torchvision.transforms`:
- Resize, normalization
- Random flips/rotations for training
- **Custom VGG-like CNN** built using `torch.nn.Sequential`.
- **Training loop** with real-time loss & accuracy tracking.
- **Evaluation** with accuracy metrics on test data.
- **GPU acceleration** when available.

---

## Model Architecture
The network follows a **VGG-inspired** design:
- Stacked convolutional layers with small receptive fields (3×3 kernels).
- Max pooling layers for spatial downsampling.
- Fully connected layers for classification.

## Requirements
```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib requests
````

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Install required dependencies.
3. Open the notebook in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.
4. Run all cells sequentially — the dataset will be downloaded automatically.
5. Adjust hyperparameters (batch size, epochs, learning rate) as needed.

---

## Output

* **Training Loss & Accuracy** per epoch.
* **Final Test Accuracy**.
* Visualization of predictions on sample test images.
* (Optional) Saved trained model weights.

---

## Example

```python
# Run model training
!jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute VGG_Architecture.ipynb

# Load trained model
model.load_state_dict(torch.load("vgg_food_classifier.pth"))
```

If you want, I can also make you a **custom, minimal VGG diagram** that exactly matches your architecture instead of using the generic Wikipedia one — that would make your README look more tailored.
